Uses two heirarchical models. The parts of the person are relative to the hips.
The parts of the bag are relative to the ball at the top.

Has fake physics and fake collision detection. I was originally going to implement
collision detection but was unsure how after a few unsuccessful attempts.

I understand the theory about it. If I were to do bounding spheres, I would check
if the distance between the center of both spheres is less than the sum of both radii,
then the objects are colliding.

Press K to kick
Press P to punch
WASD to move around

If you press punch or kick during an animation, they might end up in a wonky state afterwards.

Pressing M moves the person so that it's not in range of the punching bag. I originally implemented it so that
when collision detection was implemented, you could press M to move it away and show that the bag doesn't move when
farther away. However, since collision detection wasn't implemented in the end, the movement is useless.
